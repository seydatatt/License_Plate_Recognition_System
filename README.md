# License Plate Recognition System

This project is a License Plate Recognition System built using a character dataset and a dataset created from 21 car images. The AI model is trained to recognize license plates from the images. This project was prepared with the help of Umut Kaan Başer's YouTube video.

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a License Plate Recognition System using deep learning techniques. The system is trained to identify and read license plates from images of cars. The project utilizes a custom character dataset and images of cars to train the AI model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of two parts:
1. **Character Dataset**: A collection of character images used to train the model to recognize individual characters on the license plates.
2. **Car Images**: A dataset of 21 car images with visible license plates used to test and validate the model.

## Model
The AI model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to process the images and recognize the characters on the license plates. The model's architecture and training process are designed to achieve high accuracy in real-world scenarios.
